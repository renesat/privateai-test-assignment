The text below contains pre-extracted entities, denoted in the following format within the text:
{# whitespace #}
<entity text>[ENT<entity id>:<entity label>]
{# whitespace #}
This text was obtained automatically from a PDF file of a scientific article{%- if paper_title -%} wit title "{{ paper_title }}"{%- else -%}.{%- endif -%}
The text may contain various non-valid characters and errors in the text (merged words, wrong characters, etc.).
{# whitespace #}
From the text below, extract the meaningful relationships between the entities.
The relationships should represent facts that represent important information from the study. The following relationships can be used as an example (other relationships can be used as well):
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- for label in labels -%}
{{ label }}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{# whitespace #}
Links should be between objects. For example, a bad relationship is "Effect - increases - intravenous adrenaline". A good meaningful relationship is for example "Adrenaline - increases - QTc Interval".
{# whitespace #}
The extraction has to use the following format, with one line for each detected relation:
{# whitespace #}
{"dep": <entity id>, "dest": <entity id>, "relation": <relation label>}
{# whitespace #}
Make sure that only relevant relations are listed, and that each line is a valid JSON object.
{# whitespace #}
{%- if label_definitions -%}
Below are definitions of each label to help aid you in what kinds of relationship to extract for each label.
Assume these definitions are written by an expert and follow them closely.
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- for label, definition in label_definitions.items() -%}
{{ label }}: {{ definition }}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endif -%}
{%- if prompt_examples -%}
Below are some examples (only use these as a guide):
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- for example in prompt_examples -%}
Text:
'''
{{ preannotate(example) }}
'''
{# whitespace #}
{%- for item in example.relations -%}
{# whitespace #}
{{ item.json() }}
{%- endfor -%}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endif -%}
Here is the text that needs labeling:
